Revision of C and C++

C Language – Quick Revision
1. Basics

Procedural language

Program starts from main()

Uses functions heavily

File extension: .c

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello C");
    return 0;
}

2. Data Types

Primary: int, float, char, double

Derived: arrays, pointers

User-defined: struct, union, enum, typedef

Modifiers: short, long, signed, unsigned

3. Control Statements

Conditional: if, if-else, switch

Loops: for, while, do-while

Jump: break, continue, goto, return

4. Arrays & Strings

Array = collection of same data type

Strings are character arrays ending with '\0'

char str[10] = "Hello";


Common functions: strlen(), strcpy(), strcmp(), strcat()

5. Pointers

Stores address of a variable

Important for arrays, functions, dynamic memory

int a = 10;
int *p = &a;

6. Functions

Call by value

Call by reference (using pointers)

7. Structures & Unions

Structure: memory for all members

Union: shared memory (one member at a time)

struct Student {
    int id;
    float marks;
};

8. Dynamic Memory Allocation

malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), free()

🔹 C++ – Quick Revision
1. Basics

Object-Oriented language

Extension: .cpp

Uses cout and cin

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello C++";
    return 0;
}

2. OOP Concepts ⭐

Class & Object

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

3. Class & Object
class Student {
public:
    int id;
    void show() {
        cout << id;
    }
};

4. Constructors & Destructors

Constructor: auto-called when object is created

Destructor: auto-called when object is destroyed

Student() { }
~Student() { }

5. Inheritance

Types: Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Hybrid

class A { };
class B : public A { };

6. Polymorphism

Compile-time: Function overloading, Operator overloading

Run-time: Function overriding (using virtual)

virtual void show();

7. Pointers in C++

Similar to C

Also used with objects & dynamic memory

int *p = new int;
delete p;

8. STL (Standard Template Library)

Containers: vector, list, map, set

Iterators

Algorithms: sort(), find(), count()

🔹 C vs C++ (Very Important)
Feature	C	C++
Type	Procedural	Object-Oriented
Data Security	Low	High (Encapsulation)
OOP	❌	✅
Function Overloading	❌	✅
STL	❌	✅
🔹 Exam Tips 📝

Focus on pointers, structures, OOP concepts

Practice small programs

Remember syntax differences between C & C++

Revise C vs C++ comparisons
